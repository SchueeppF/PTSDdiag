## Description 
PTSDdiag is a comprehensive R package for analyzing and simplifying PTSD diagnostic criteria using PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5) data. It provides tools to identify optimal subsets of six PCL-5 items that maintain diagnostic accuracy while reducing assessment burden. 

## **Key Features**

 * Data preparation and standardization for PCL-5 scores
 * Implementation of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria
 * Calculation of diagnostic metrics and summary statistics
 * Simplification of diagnostic criteria through:
    * Hierarchical (cluster-based) approach
    * Non-hierarchical approach
 * Comparison of different diagnostic approaches
 * Model validation using:
    * Holdout Validation
    * Cross-Validation

## Installation

This package is currently only hosted on GitHub. It can be installed using the usual way:
``` {r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WeidmannL/PTSDdiag")
```

## Getting Started

The vignette demonstrates how to use the package to prepare the PCL-5 data, calculate some basic descriptive statistics and reliability metrics, find the optimal minimal symptom combinations for PTSD diagnosis, compare different diagnostic approaches and perform validation methods for evaluating model performance.
