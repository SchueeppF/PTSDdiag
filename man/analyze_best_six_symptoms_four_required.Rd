\title{Find optimal non-hierarchical six-symptom combinations for PTSD diagnosis}
\usage{
analyze_best_six_symptoms_four_required(data, score_by = "false_cases")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing exactly 20 columns with PCL-5 item scores
(output of rename_ptsd_columns). Each symptom should be scored on a 0-4
scale where:
* 0 = Not at all
* 1 = A little bit
* 2 = Moderately
* 3 = Quite a bit
* 4 = Extremely}

\item{score_by}{Character string specifying optimization criterion:
* "false_cases": Minimize total misclassifications
* "newly_nondiagnosed": Minimize false negatives only}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  * best_symptoms: List of three vectors, each containing six symptom numbers
    representing the best combinations found
  * diagnosis_comparison: Dataframe comparing original DSM-5 diagnosis with
    diagnoses based on the three best combinations
  * summary: Interactive datatable (DT) showing diagnostic accuracy metrics
    for each combination
}
\description{
Identifies the three best six-symptom combinations for PTSD diagnosis
where any four symptoms must be present, regardless of their cluster membership.
This function implements a simplified diagnostic approach compared to the full
DSM-5 criteria.
}
\details{
The function:
1. Tests all possible combinations of 6 symptoms from the 20 PCL-5 items
2. Requires 4 symptoms to be present (â‰¥2 on original 0-4 scale) for diagnosis
3. Identifies the three combinations that best match the original DSM-5 diagnosis

Optimization can be based on either:
* Minimizing false cases (both false positives and false negatives)
* Minimizing only false negatives (newly non-diagnosed cases)

The symptom clusters in PCL-5 are:
* Items 1-5: Intrusion symptoms (Criterion B)
* Items 6-7: Avoidance symptoms (Criterion C)
* Items 8-14: Negative alterations in cognitions and mood (Criterion D)
* Items 15-20: Alterations in arousal and reactivity (Criterion E)
