\title{Summarize changes in PTSD diagnostic metrics}
\usage{
summarize_ptsd_changes(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe where:
* Each column represents a different diagnostic criterion
* Must include a column named "PTSD_orig" as the baseline criterion
* Values are logical (TRUE/FALSE) indicating whether PTSD criteria are met
* Each row represents one case/participant}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the following columns for each diagnostic criterion:
  * column: Name of the diagnostic criterion
  * diagnosed: Number of cases diagnosed as PTSD
  * non_diagnosed: Number of cases not diagnosed as PTSD
  * diagnosed_percent: Percentage of cases diagnosed
  * non_diagnosed_percent: Percentage of cases not diagnosed
  * newly_diagnosed: Cases diagnosed under new but not baseline criterion
  * newly_nondiagnosed: Cases diagnosed under baseline but not new criterion
  * true_positive: Cases diagnosed under both criteria
  * true_negative: Cases not diagnosed under either criterion
  * true_cases: Sum of true positives and true negatives
  * false_cases: Sum of newly diagnosed and newly non-diagnosed
  * sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv: Standard diagnostic accuracy metrics
}
\description{
Compares different PTSD diagnostic criteria by calculating diagnostic accuracy
metrics and changes in diagnosis status relative to a baseline criterion.

#' @details
The function calculates multiple diagnostic metrics comparing each diagnostic
criterion to a baseline criterion (PTSD_orig):

Basic counts:
* Number and percentage of diagnosed/non-diagnosed cases per criterion
* Number of newly diagnosed and newly non-diagnosed cases
* True positive and true negative cases

Diagnostic accuracy metrics:
* Sensitivity: Proportion of true PTSD cases correctly identified
* Specificity: Proportion of non-PTSD cases correctly identified
* PPV (Positive Predictive Value): Probability that a positive diagnosis is correct
* NPV (Negative Predictive Value): Probability that a negative diagnosis is correct
