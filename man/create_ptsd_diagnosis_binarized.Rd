\title{Determine PTSD diagnosis based on DSM-5 criteria using binarized scores}
\usage{
create_ptsd_diagnosis_binarized(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing exactly 20 columns of PCL-5 item scores
  (output of rename_ptsd_columns) named symptom_1 to symptom_20. Each symptom
  should be scored on a 0-4 scale where:
  * 0 = Not at all
  * 1 = A little bit
  * 2 = Moderately
  * 3 = Quite a bit
  * 4 = Extremely

Note: This function should only be used with raw symptom scores (output of
rename_ptsd_columns) and not with data containing a total score column, as
the internal binarization process would invalidate the total score.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with a single column "PTSD_orig" containing TRUE/FALSE
  values indicating whether DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are met based on
  binarized scores
}
\description{
Determines whether DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD are met using binarized
symptom scores (0/1) for PCL-5 items. This is an alternative to
determine_ptsd_diagnosis() that works with pre-binarized data.
}
\details{
The function applies the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD using binary
indicators of symptom presence:
* Criterion B (Intrusion): At least 1 present symptom from items 1-5
* Criterion C (Avoidance): At least 1 present symptom from items 6-7
* Criterion D (Negative alterations in cognitions and mood):
  At least 2 present symptoms from items 8-14
* Criterion E (Alterations in arousal and reactivity):
  At least 2 present symptoms from items 15-20
}

)

# Get diagnosis using binarized approach
