\title{Rename PTSD symptom (= PCL-5 item) columns}
\usage{
rename_ptsd_columns(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing exactly 20 columns, where each column
  represents a PCL-5 item score. The scores should be on a 0-4 scale where:

\itemize{
  \item 0 = Not at all
  \item 1 = A little bit
  \item 2 = Moderately
  \item 3 = Quite a bit
  \item 4 = Extremely
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the same data but renamed columns following the pattern
  'symptom_1' through 'symptom_20'
}
\description{
Standardizes column names in PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5) data by renaming
them to a consistent format (symptom_1 through symptom_20). This standardization
is essential for subsequent analyses using other functions in the package.
}
\details{
The function assumes the input data contains exactly 20 columns corresponding to
the 20 items of the PCL-5. The columns are renamed sequentially from symptom_1
to symptom_20, maintaining their original order. The PCL-5 items correspond to
different symptom clusters:

\itemize{
\item symptom_1 to symptom_5: Intrusion symptoms (Criterion B)
\item symptom_6 to symptom_7: Avoidance symptoms (Criterion C)
\item symptom_8 to symptom_14: Negative alterations in cognitions and mood (Criterion D)
\item symptom_15 to symptom_20: Alterations in arousal and reactivity (Criterion E)
}
}
\examples{
# Example with a sample PCL-5 dataset
sample_data <- data.frame(
  matrix(sample(0:4, 20 * 10, replace = TRUE),
         nrow = 10,
         ncol = 20)
)
renamed_data <- rename_ptsd_columns(sample_data)
colnames(renamed_data)  # Shows new column names

}
